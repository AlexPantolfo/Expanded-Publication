# Expanded-Publication
## Brief
The starting point of this task is the following article: “In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment on Vertical Perspective”, by Hito Steyerl. The staff team proposes this post-digital article as a diagnosis for the current state of our online in-isolation physical/virtual selves. A state which lacks any of our original stability and in which usual daily rhythms and routines have been replaced by the internet 24/7, free content, self-help, motivational messages, and 'status updates. The interpretation of the article leads to the development of a virtual publication and design, a published digital outcome that engages with context and ideas. The focus is on articulating and communicating an experimental approach to narrative and publication through the exploration of editorial for the screen, typography, image, layout, interaction, and context.
